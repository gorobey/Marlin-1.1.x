# GA20-Marlin-1.1.x
 
This is a firmware update for my Geeetech A20, and is based on Marlin 1.1.x bugfix.
Contains various changes:

    Disable endstop Z min (only works with blotouch installed)
    Union of babystaps and Z-offset
    FAST_PWM_FAN enable
    Auto bed levelling grid 4x4 (3 probe for point)
    faderate/acceleration/jerk/pressure advance
    Lite menu
    No filament sensor
    Hardcoded custom scripts and varius routine
    And more...

Please inspect Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h for more datails!

Remenber: This program comes with absolutely no warranty:
Works perfectly on my A20, but is modded (I converted it to direct drive and some improvements to the chassis)
